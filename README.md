This process includes the following three areas of work:

1.Semantic segmentation based on MSD-SF model.

2.3D reconstruction of plant organs.

3.Extraction of plant architectural traits.

Example data are also given in /data_examples, /MSD-SF/datasets, /3D reconstruction/datasets, /3D reconstruction/map_and_pose_data, /plant architectural traits extraction/bootstrap/instances_and_traits_data for reference.
